`./data-phi-free/derived/meta` Directory
=========

Contains meta data extracted from individual data pulls. Each pull (e.g. RAND-2017-02-08) is differentiated by the type of data files (RAND) and the time stamp (2017-02-08). 

WARNING:  variables names can change as HRS updates their sources!!

These files are replaced every time you run `./manipulation/0-ellis-island.R`.
